# 1. My final project will be to render a 2D simulation of fireworks. It will include multiple fireworks of different colors that explode into different patterns. The fireworks will be randomly placed along the x-axis and go up to a random height along the y-axis before exploding. The texture map will include simple colors with gradients to give objects a realistic look. As a stretch goal, I will include background objects and have each fireworks give off light.
#
#
# 2. Week 1: Collect information, image reference for fireworks and videos of them exploding for sprites. 
#
#    Week 2: Complete the code to implement the firework before and after the explosion.
#
#    Week 3: Add motion for the firework moving up and the explosion moving outwards and then arching downwards.
#
#    Week 4: Implement random positioning and height.
#
#    Week 5: (Stretch goal) Add lights to the fireworks as they explode.
#
#
# 3. I will create a web-based application using THREE.js
